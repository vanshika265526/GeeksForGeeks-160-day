/*
Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
